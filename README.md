# Focus Macro Maker

Automatically creates and updates a focus macro.

The addon solves a simple problem: you enter a group, and someone has a focus macro with the same mark as you. You don't want to edit your macro because it's cumbersome, and you can't remember which number corresponds to each mark anyway.

The addon has a simple UI:
`/fmm` or `/focusmacromaker`
